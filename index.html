            <h2>THE WELLNESS PROGRAM</h2>
            <p>While many efforts have been made to reduce the health gap between Aboriginal youth and non-Aboriginal youth, there continues to be a large disparity in all health outcomes, including mental health. From 2001 to 2010, the highest suicide rate was reported for Indigenous males aged 25-29 years.</p>
            <p>While traditional counselling can be helpful for many, a holistic view of mental health exists in Aboriginal culture, with an emphasis on connection to land, spirituality, ancestry, family, culture and community. headspace Fremantle has developed an innovative program to address the disconnect between traditional service delivery and cultural appropriateness. The Wellness through Connection to Country program will provide Aboriginal youth with an opportunity to explore their identity, culture, language and country to help foster wellness. </p>
            <p>All funds rasied from the gala will contribute to the program.</p>
            <h2>headspace FREMANTLE</h2>
            <p>headspace Fremantle has been helping young people of south-west metropolitan Perth since officially launching in 2009. In that time, we have helped 8000 young people! While we aim to raise awareness of mental health in the wider community, reduce stigma and encourage early help seeking, we are also passionate about improving access to services for disadvantaged youth. </p>
